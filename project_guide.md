# Blood Pressure Tracking Application - Complete Project Plan

## Project Context

This is a comprehensive web application designed to help individuals and families track blood pressure readings over time. The primary use case is for people with hypertension (like your mother) who need to monitor their BP daily and share this data with family members for health management purposes.

### What This Project Does

**Core Purpose:** Enable systematic tracking, visualization, and family sharing of blood pressure measurements with historical analysis and health insights.

**Key Functionality:**
- Daily BP entry with timestamp and optional comments
- Visual charts showing BP trends over customizable time periods
- Family group system for sharing health data with relatives
- Automated reminder notifications for regular BP monitoring
- Category-based health indicators (normal, elevated, high BP stages)
- Responsive design optimized for all devices, especially mobile phones

**Target Users:** Individuals with hypertension, elderly patients, family caregivers, and healthcare-conscious families who want to maintain collaborative health monitoring.

## Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- React.js with Vite (not CRA)
- Shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- SCSS with BEM methodology for custom styles
- Chart.js or Recharts for data visualization
- Axios for API calls
- React Router for navigation
- React Hook Form for form handling
- Date-fns or Dayjs for date manipulation

**Backend:**
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- JWT for authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing
- nodemailer for email notifications
- node-cron for scheduled notifications
- cors for cross-origin requests

**Additional Tools:**
- Postman for API testing
- Git for version control
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
